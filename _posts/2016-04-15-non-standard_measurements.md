title: Target tracking using non-standard measurements
category: SF
---
## Background
Target tracking concerns estimating the movement of one or more objects based on measurements of the objects. Most commonly, the measurements are position measurements, e.g., range and bearing. If the sensor has Doppler capabilities, also velocity measurements can be used. 

Another type of measurements, which less frequently are utilized, are so-called feature measurements. These include measurements of target class, spectral measurements (e.g., color) and most importantly measurements of target strength. Feature measurements are often used to aid data association, i.e., to help distinguish a target from its surroundings or from other targets. 

For sufficiently large targets, target extent and shape can also be used as a measurement. This can also provide discriminatory capabilities, and it can can tell us something about where the target is heading. 

The aim of this autumn project is to explore the potential of such non-standard measurements in target tracking for maritime collision avoidance.

## Proposed Tasks
Tasks for the autumn project:

1. Write a survey on feature measurements and other non-standard measurements used in the target tracking literature.
2. Select three such measurement types and investigate their potential for target detection, data association or state estimation through simulations and/or implementation on radar data. 
3. Discuss the findings in a report.

## Autosea
The candidate will be associated with the AUTOSEA project, which is a collaborative research project between NTNU, DNV GL, Kongsberg Maritime and Maritime Robotics, focused on achieving world-leading competence and knowledge in the design and verification of methods and systems for sensor fusion and COLAV for ASVs. The project has access to supervision and physical test platforms through our industry partners.

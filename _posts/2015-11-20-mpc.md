title:  A model-predictive control approach to collision avoidance for ASVs
[//]: # subtitle: Visualization and Situation Awareness
---
Model-predictive control (MPC) is an advanced control technique consisting in the definition of a cost function depending on the predicted behavior of controlled variables on the basis of the model and according to a prescribed set of constraints. The desired control action is then obtained through an optimization procedure over a finite prediction horizon.

The objective of the thesis is the study of an MPC approach to the collision avoidance problem for unmanned ships. Predictions and optimization are key ingredients in the design of reliable and efficient collision avoidance control schemes, which typically include both physical constraints, e.g. input bounds and operational limits, and logic constraints, e.g. navigation rules. The workload has to be divided into a theoretical part, consisting in the analysis and synthesis of the system architecture, and a simulation part, using a suitable numerical optimization toolbox.

title:  Fault-tolerant control allocation and robust path following for ASVs
[//]: # subtitle: Visualization and Situation Awareness
---
The main objective of control allocation is to determine how to generate a specified control effect from a redundant set of effectors. Control effectors are devices or surfaces producing forces and moments, such as thrusters, propellers, fins or rudders. The redundancy is moreover a key advantage in the case of malfunctions and failures of control devices, as the desired control input generation can be redistributed over the set of healthy effectors.

The target of this master thesis project is to exploit these concepts and their application to fault-tolerant path following for ASV, in accordance with navigation rules and collision avoidance policies. The work will first consists in the study of theoretical methods, based on algebraic/geometric control allocation and optimization techniques, fault diagnosis schemes and robust path following algorithms, and then in the development of a ship simulator integrating all such features.

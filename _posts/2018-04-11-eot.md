## Background

During 2017 the prototype of an autonomous ferry has been built and launched by researchers at NTNU. The 6 meter long prototype is a precursor of a twice as large ferry intended for passenger transport over the canal between Ravnkloa and Brattøra. The ferry will use a variety of sensors to perceive its surroundings and avoid collisions with other vessels. The primary sensor for this task will be a Velodyne lidar.

Target tracking is a central component of the ferry's sensor system. Based on the raw sensor data, software must detect other objects, and estimate their locations and velocities. Many different tracking methods exist, and which method is most appropriate depends on the sensors used. The primary sensor for collision avoidance will be an automotive lidar, while cameras and radars also will be considered. Lidar and radar are both active sensors, which can measure both range and bearing. A key difference between radar and lidar is that the lidar has much higher resolution.

Traditional tracking methods have largely been motivated by military radar applications. A key assumption of these methods is that an object yields maximally one detection in each sensor scan. For lidar, this assumption is rather dubious. The lidar returns a point clould, where several points will come from a given object such as a ship. Furthermore, the ferry will operate in a confined environment, where it will have to maneuver very close to other vessels. It is therefore important to estimate the extents of other vessels, in addition to their kinematic states. This is known as Extended Object Tracking (EOT).

This is a fairly recent and exciting research field. Research on EOT needs to answer several important and difficult questions:

- How should target extent be parameterized?
- How does one figure out which measurements comes from the object, and which measurements are noise? (This is known as data association).
- How does one deal with situations where only parts of the object is visible?
- How should maneuvers of an extended object be modeled?

This autumn project will build upon a previous autumn project and master thesis to develop a reliable EOT method for the autonomous ferry. The focus will be on tracking of boats of a certain size such as the Munkholmen ferry.

## Proposed Tasks

Tasks for the autumn project:

1. Conduct a literature study on relevant methods for multi-target tracking and extended object tracking.
2. Describe similarities and differences between conventional multi-target tracking and extended object tracking in the report.
3. Propose a solution to the data association problem in single-target lidar tracking of sizeable objects. <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7284009/">Schuster & Reuter</a> can serve as a starting point.
4. Propose a solution to the filtering problem in single-target lidar tracking of sizeable objects.
5. Test the methods in simulations and on real data.
6. Discuss the findings in a report.

For the MSc project several directions are possible.

- Application of the methods in collision avoidance systems.
- More extensive data gathering, using the lidar mounted on the autonomous ferry prototype.
- In-depth studies of multi-target and/or multi-scan EOT, and track initialization of EOT.
- Applications of EOT in radar tracking or fusion between different sensors.
- EOT is actually related to the much more well-studied problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The object in EOT can be viewed as a map which the observer moves relative to. An amibitous but very interesting project could be to bring tools from state of the art SLAM methods into the field of EOT (e.g., factor graphs).

## Prerequisites

Required backgroud knowledge

- Experience in either Matlab, Python or C++.
- TTK4115 - Linear System Theory.

Useful but not required background knowledge

- Additional courses in statistics, estimation, sensor systems and/or machine learning.
- Knowledge of ROS.
- Knowledge of SLAM.
- You should feel comfortable working with theory, and with uncertainty.

This is a project of utmost importance for the safety of the autonomous ferry. The project is in the research front of sensor fusion, with many possibilities for publicity, both academically and in popular media.

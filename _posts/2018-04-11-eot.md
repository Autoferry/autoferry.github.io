## Background
Target tracking concerns estimating the movement of one or more objects based on measurements of the objects. Most commonly, the measurements of an object is assumed to be a single point in range and bearing, or in cartesian coordinates. However, when sensors with high resolution is used, this assumption becomes questionable, as the extent of observed objects also can be seen.

Estimating the extent jointly with the kinematic state is known as extended object tracking (EOT). This is a fairly recent field which entails several challenges. Research on EOT needs to answer several important and difficult questions:

- How should target extent be parameterized?
- How does one figure out which measurements comes from the object, and which measurements are noise? (This is known as data association).
- How does one deal with situations where only parts of the object is visible?
- How should maneuvers of an extended object be modeled?

EOT is of particular relevance to the autonomous ferry application. Short-range high-resolution sensors (e.g., lidar) will be used for collision avoidance. Since the Canal is relatively narrow the ferry will inevitably have to navigate very close other vessels, and having a good estimate of their extents is therefore very important.

This autumn project will build upon a previous autumn project and master thesis to develop a reliable EOT method for the autonomous ferry. The focus will be on tracking of boats of a certain size such as the Munkholmen ferry.

## Proposed Tasks

Tasks for the autumn project:

1. Conduct a literature study on relevant methods for multi-target tracking and extended object tracking.
2. Describe similarities and differences between conventional multi-target tracking and extended object tracking in the report.
3. Propose a solution to the data association problem in single-target lidar tracking of sizeable objects.
4. Propose a solution to the filtering problem in single-target lidar tracking of sizeable objects.
5. Test the methods in simulations and on real data.
6. Discuss the findings in a report.

For the MSc project several directions are possible.

- Application of the methods in collision avoidance systems.
- More extensive data gathering, using the lidar mounted on the autonomous ferry prototype.
- In-depth studies of multi-target and/or multi-scan EOT, and track initialization of EOT.
- Applications of EOT in radar tracking or sensor fusion.
- EOT is actually related to the much more well-studied problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). An amibitous but very interesting project could be to bring tools from state of the art SLAM methods into the field of EOT (e.g., factor graphs).

## Prerequisites

Required backgroud knowledge

- Experience in either Matlab, Python or C++.
- TTK4115 - Linear System Theory.

Useful but not required background knowledge

- Additional courses in statistics, estimation, sensor systems and/or machine learning.
- Knowledge of ROS
- Knowledge of SLAM.
- You should feel comfortable working with theory, and with uncertainty.

This is a project of utmost importance for the safety of the autonomous ferry, with a strong potential for contributing to defining the research front in sensor fusion.

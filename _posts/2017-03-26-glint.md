subtitle: To get your bearings
category: SF

## Background
The Autosea project in colloboration with [AMOS](http://ntnu.edu/amos) aims to build knowledge that enables autonomous collision avoidance for maritime surface vehicles. Target tracking is an important capability of autonomous vehicles moving in environments with traffic, as the autonomous vehicle needs to keep track of all other moving objects in its vicinity, and predict their future movement. Target tracking entails processing of data from various exteroceptive sensors, such as radar, lidar or camera. Target tracking consists of two fundamental tasks: State estimation and data association. The latter task arises because a sensor typically provides a set of potential measurements, of which only one, if any, is the true measurement that should be used by the state estimation. 

Radar tends to be the most reliable and robust of the imaging sensors mentioned, but it also suffers from weaknesses of its own. One such weakness is the issue of glint: Interference between nearby scatterers on the target may cause the bearing measurement to deviate significantly from its true value. Apart from such phenomona, the radar is of course subject to the same trade-offs between misdetections and false alarms as any other sensor is.

## Scope
If the tracking method is “made aware” that glint can occur, it may put less emphasis on suspicious measurements.  The goal of this project is to automate this awareness, both in state estimation and in data association. 

## Proposed Tasks for the 5th year project

1. Conduct a literature study on previous approaches to dealing with glint noise in target tracking.
2. Implement a basic single-target tracking method. The Integrated Probabilistic Data Association (IPDA) is suggested as a suitable starting point.
3. Equip the tracking method with resilience against glint measurements.
4. Compare with the results with standard methods (Ordinary IPDA, PDAF with M-out-of-N logic for track termination, MHT, etc.)
5. Write report.

## Proposed Tasks for the master thesis

In the master’s project the goal shall be to extend the developments of the 5th year project into a bona-fide multi-target tracking method. This includes tasks such as

1. Conduct a literature survey on multi-target tracking methods that involve the concept of target existence.
2. Implement a multi-target tracking method, for example some variation of the JIPDA or MHT. 
3. Incorporate an ability for judging whether a track is caused by glint measurements from another target. 
4. Compare with the results with standard methods.
5. Write report.


## Prerequisites
Required background knowledge:

- Experience in either Matlab, Python or C++.
- TTK4115 Linear System Theory.

Useful, but not required, background knowledge:

## Autosea
The candidate will be associated with the AUTOSEA project, which is a collaborative research project between NTNU, DNV GL, Kongsberg Maritime and Maritime Robotics, focused on achieving world-leading competence and knowledge in the design and verification of methods and systems for sensor fusion and COLAV for ASVs. The project has access to supervision and physical test platforms through our industry partners.

title: Automatic adjustment of maritime radar
subtitle: Gain and anti-clutter settings
category: SF
---
## Background
Human navigators adjusts the ship radar parameters regularly to obtain a good radar plot. There are several settings that can be adjusted, but the most important are gain and anti-clutter. The gain setting amplifies the return of the radar, which makes it more sensitive. This leads to an increased number of detections. To avoid too many false alarms, the operator can apply anti-clutter settings to reduce the return from waves, spray and rain.

## Scope
To increase the autonomy of a ship, some of this functionality needs to be performed by the tracking system. To tune the radar, there must be complementary sensors which are able to provide locations where there surely are targets, such as other ships, and locations where there are no targets. The radar parameters can then be adjusted to match these features.

## Proposed Tasks
1. Obtain knowledge of radars with a focus on detection theory and a maritime setting.
2. Suggest complementary sensors to ensure that the radar settings can be set correctly.
3. Develop a method for automatically adjusting the radar settings.
4. Present the results and discuss limitations and challenges.

## Prerequisites
* [TTK4115](http://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TTK4115) - Linear System Theory

## Autosea
The candidate will be associated with the AUTOSEA project, which is a collaborative research project between NTNU, DNV GL, Kongsberg Maritime and Maritime Robotics, focused on achieving world-leading competence and knowledge in the design and verification of methods and systems for sensor fusion and COLAV for ASVs. The project has access to supervision and physical test platforms through our industry partners.

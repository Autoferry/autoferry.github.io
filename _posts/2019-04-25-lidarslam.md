title: Lidar-based SLAM and localization for autonomous ferry
category: SF
---
## Background
The navigation of the autonomous ferry Milliampere is currently based on GNSS. For improved robustness, especially in docking scenarios,
this system should be complemented by navigation done purely by means of onboard sensors. 
The ferry is currently equipped with lidar, radar, optical cameras and infrafred cameras. 
The lidar is an interesting candidate as navigation aid since it is an active sensor (provides range measurements) and because of its high resolution.

title: Automatic adjustment of maritime radar
subtitle: Gain and anti-clutter settings
category: SF

## Background
The key sensor used in maritime collision avoidance is the radar, which is quite reliable both day and night and in all kinds of weather. However, the output depends on the software settings, which human navigators regularly adjusts to obtain a good radar plot. There are several settings that can be adjusted, but the most important are gain and anti-clutter. The gain setting amplifies the return of the radar, which makes it more sensitive. This leads to an increased number of detections. To avoid too many false alarms, the operator can apply anti-clutter settings to reduce the return from waves, spray and rain.

## Proposed Tasks
For the autumn project, the following tasks should be solved:

1. Write a brief survey on different methods for radar detection and clustering.
2. Discuss how other tracking sensors can aid radar tuning.
3. Implement a detection and tracking algorithm.
4. Evaluate the performance given a set of tuning parameters.

For the master thesis, the results from the autumn project will be used to form interesting and relevant tasks.

## Prerequisites
* [TTK4115](http://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TTK4115) - Linear System Theory

## Autosea
The candidate will be associated with the AUTOSEA project, which is a collaborative research project between NTNU, DNV GL, Kongsberg Maritime and Maritime Robotics, focused on achieving world-leading competence and knowledge in the design and verification of methods and systems for sensor fusion and COLAV for ASVs. The project has access to supervision and physical test platforms through our industry partners.

title:  Collision avoidance for ASVs using velocity obstacle 
subtitle: Integration with LOS guidance and handling of complex and ambiguous situations.
---
The velocity obstacle is a popular and well-established approach for maritime collision avoidance. In this method, velocities that will lead to collision with an obstacle any time in the future are excluded from the space of allowed velocities. Key benefits of this method is that it is computationally cheap, and that it easily can be adapted to take traffic rules at sea (COLREGS) into account. A major drawback is that it relies on an assumption of constant velocities.

In this project, the first objective will be to integrate the velocity obstacle in line-of-sight-based guidance. Then, solutions shall be developed for some of the scenarios that currently poses challenges to velocity obstacle based collision avoidance. Such situations include oscillatory wobbling/hesitation, complex traffic, vehicles in formation, presence of both moving and static obstacles, violations of COLREGS and collision avoidance with limited or uncertain sensor information.

## Autosea
The candidate will be associated with the AUTOSEA project, which is a collaborative research project between NTNU, DNV GL, Kongsberg Maritime and Maritime Robotics, focused on achieving world-leading competence and knowledge in the design and verification of methods and systems for sensor fusion and COLAV for ASVs. The project has access to supervision and physical test platforms through our industry partners.

Model-predictive control (MPC) is an advanced control technique consisting in the definition of a cost function depending on the predicted behavior of controlled variables on the basis of the model and according to a prescribed set of constraints. The desired control action is then obtained through an optimization procedure over a finite prediction horizon.

The objective of the thesis is the study of an MPC approach to the collision avoidance problem for unmanned surface vehicles in confined harbor environments.

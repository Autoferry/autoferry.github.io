title: Wind and ocean current estimation/prediction for ASVs
[//]: # subtitle: Visualization and Situation Awareness
---
Environmental disturbances such as wind and ocean currents are a major challenge for efficient navigation and control of small unmanned ships. Even though good autopilots can achieve good performances when the ship is in motion on a straight path between two selected way-points, the presence of environmental forces cannot be neutralized when the ship is commanded to stop and affects the turning rate capabilities. In order to enhance safety of autonomous operations and avoid hazardous maneuvers, it is very important to predict the ship trajectory with a reasonably good accuracy.

After a careful review of existing methods, the focus of this master thesis project will be first to develop a wind and current estimator based on the standard sensor suite and the ship kinematic model, and then to integrate the estimation with a Collision Avoidance simulator in order to improve the ship motion predictions. Possible approaches include: integral LOS guidance, robust observers, Kalman filtering, statistical methods. It would be also interesting to investigate the applicability of wind/disturbances estimators developed in other domains, e.g. aerospace or automotive.

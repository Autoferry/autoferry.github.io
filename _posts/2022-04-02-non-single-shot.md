title: Integrated detection and tracking

## Background

An automated situational awareness systems for autonomous vehicles must detect and track near by moving objects to avoid collisions. 
The majority of tracking methods, whether optical or radar-based, are based on the philosophy of tracking-by-detection, where the tracking method is fed detections from a stream of images or sensor scans. Typically, these detections of a single-shot nature: Every image in the stream is processed independently of the other images. 

Clearly, this is in principle suboptimal. By processing several images simultaneously, one may have sufficient information available to discover moving objects that would be impossible to detect with any reasonable confidence from a single image.

title: Visual Detection
subtitle: Optical Sensors for Maritime Collision Avoidance
---
## Background
The Autosea project aims to build knowledge that enables autonomous collision avoidance for maritime surface vehicles. In addition to ship instrumentation such as RADAR and AIS, a human navigator relies on his vision as an important tool to avoid collisions at sea. The International Regulations for Avoiding Collisions at Sea (COLREGS) explicitly states that navigators should use their vision in addition to RADAR. As computer vision continues to show success in many robotics domains, including extraplanetary exploration on NASAs Curiosity Mars rover and many autonomous driving applications, is is likely that optical sensors will have a prominent role in autonomous collision avoidance at sea.

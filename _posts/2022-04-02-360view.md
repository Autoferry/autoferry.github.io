title: 360 degrees view for the operator of milliAmpere 2
category: SF
---
## Background

Many modern cars are equipped with a system of parking cameras that provides the driver with 360 degree birds-eye view during low speed driving. 
This is very useful when maneuvering in tight spaces such as parking houses. The autonomous ferry milliAmpere 2 may also have to maneuver in confined spaces, between other boats of various sizes in the Trondheim City Canal. It is equipped with several cameras, which together will provide a full 360 degree view. However, these have so far been primarily intended as a data source for autonomous operation.

## Scope

The goal of this project is to develop a system that enables the operator of milliAmpere 2 to obtain 360 degree vision around milliAmpere 2, to improve the operator's situational awareness during remote control. 

## Proposed Tasks for the 5th year project

In the 5th year project the goal is to develop a system for image stitching, fusion and transformation that can be used to achieve the 360 degree vision.

## Proposed Tasks for the master thesis

Several variations of the subsequent master thesis are possible. All of these are focused on making the image stitching system into a more elaborate system for situational awareness. Possible tasks may include some of the following:

* Make a real-time fused video stream onboard milliAmpere 2.
* Make a complete system for transferring the fused video stream to the shore control centre at Nyhavna. 
* Integrate sensor fusion and automated situational awareness from the autonomy system into the fused video stream.

title: 360 degrees view for the operator of milliAmpere 2
category: SF
---
## Background

Many modern cars are equipped with a system of parking cameras that provides the driver with 360 degree birds-eye view during low speed driving. 
This is very useful when maneuvering in tight spaces such as parking houses. The autonomous ferry milliAmpere 2 may also have to maneuver in confined spaces, between other boats of various sizes in the Trondheim City Canal. It is equipped with several cameras, which together will provide a full 360 degree view. However, these have so far been primarily intended as a data source for autonomous operation.

## Scope

The goal of this project is to develop a system that enables the operator of milliAmpere 2 to obtain 360 degree vision around milliAmpere 2, to improve the operator's situational awareness during remote control. 

## Proposed Tasks for the 5th year project

In the 5th year project the goal is to develop a system for image stitching, fusion and transformation that can be used to achieve the 360 degree vision. 

1. Make yourself familiar with basic theory for random finite sets and metrics for multi-target densities.  
2. Implement the Hellinger metric and some other multi-Bernoulli distance measures on two purely simulated data sets and assess whether the distance measures are meaningful. Other distance measures can be the Kullback-Leibler divergence and various measures in the so-called class of Csiszar information functionals.
3. Propose guidelines for threshold values: When is the distributional metric low enough to consider the output of the two trackers similar?
4. Propose tuning strategies using a distributional metric. How can, e.g., the Hellinger metric, be used to decide reasonable values of clutter rates, detection probabilities and covariances in a multi-target tracking system?
5. To evaluate the multi-Bernoulli Hellinger metric we make use of importance sampling. For tracking output with more than a handful of tracks more efficient evaluation techniques are needed. One possibility can be to make use of assignment techniques such as Murty's method. 
6. Write report.

## Proposed Tasks for the master thesis

Several variations of the subsequent master thesis are possible. All of these are focused on making the image stitching system into a more elaborate system for situational awareness. Possible tasks may include some of the following:

* Make a real-time fused video stream onboard milliAmpere 2.
* Make a complete system for transferring the fused video stream to the shore control centre at Nyhavna. 
* Integrate sensor fusion and automated situational awareness from the autonomy system into the fused video stream.

## Prerequisites

The candidate should have taken the course  [TTK4250 Sensor fusion] or similar before beginning this 5th year project. Background in detection theory, from e.g. [TTT4275 Estimation, Detection and Classification] will also be useful.
